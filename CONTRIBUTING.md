## Contributing to dunderscore

- Before you open a ticket or send a pull request, [search](https://github.com/juiceinc/dunderscore/issues) for previous discussions about the same feature or issue. Add to the earlier ticket if you find one.

- Create your own fork of the project where you can make changes.

- Install dunderscore's development dependencies with `npm install`.

- Make your changes while maintaining the same [coding style as Underscore](https://github.com/documentcloud/underscore/blob/master/underscore.js).
Add any tests that are needed and run `npm test` to catch any test failures or lint issues.

- Submit a [pull request](https://github.com/juiceinc/dunderscore/compare) for feedback. Do not re-build the minified `dunderscore-min.js` file as part of your pull request.
